## Installing the dependencies
    install @types/node typescript ---> installing types for node to run typescript
    install ts-node to run the server
    install the tsconfig.json file for configuring typescript --> npx tsconfig.json (node)


## ts-node is slow and do not use in prod
## watch command 
"watch": "tsc -w" ----> this compiles our ts code and converts into the js

create a second start for which we can run the js file which is complied version of our ts file i.e. node dist/index.js
# Install nodemon to act like a like server for the changes we made and add in the "DEV" ---> npm i -g node-dev 

IMP
#### YOU NEED TO RUN BOTH WATCH AND DEV TO COMPILE THE CHANGES FROM TS TO JS
